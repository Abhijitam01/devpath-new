# Project Status Report: The Step-by-Step App Building Platform

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** May 25, 2025

---

## 1. Project Summary

**Project Goal:** To build a powerful, impactful platform that helps users escape "tutorial hell" by guiding them through the process of building real-world applications step-by-step, focusing on teaching *how* to think and build rather than just providing code to copy. The platform emphasizes active learning, delayed code previews, and a clean, motivating UI/UX.

**Current Phase:** [e.g., MVP Development, Alpha Testing, Beta Launch Prep]

**Timeline Status:** [e.g., On Track, Slightly Behind, Ahead of Schedule - Explain briefly if not On Track]
